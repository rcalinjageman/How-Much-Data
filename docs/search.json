    "text": "The topic of this course is sample-size planning: How do you know how much data to collect for a research project? \nStrangely, this is not often a point of emphasis in our scientific training. It is common for even advanced graduate courses in statistics to omit this topic or touch on it rarely. Even worse, the informal training you might receive in a lab is often wrong.\nThe lack of strong training on sample-size determination in science is worrisome. You wouldn’t get into a plane with a pilot who didn’t have a flight plan. So it seems a bit strange that often we charge off into experimentation with no real sense of where we are going and when it will end. That’s a missed opportunity, because with just a bit of initial planning we can do research that is more fruitful and reproducible. \nThe goal of this workshop is to dymystify sample-size planning and to provide actionable, practical advice about how to develop solid sample-size plans for your research. This course was developed not by a professional statistician but by a neuroscientist who accidentally fell down the rabbit hole of caring deeply about statistical inference. Thus, the course hopes to present material clearly, in language fellow bench-scientists can understand without having to delve too deeply into statistical arcana.   \nHere’s the outline of the course:\n\nFirst, we’ll discuss why sample-size planning is so vital to good science and therefore why it is worth investing your time and energy into completing this workshop. You may have been driven to this class because of some external mandate imposed by a funder or training program. The goal for this section is to help develop your own, intrinsic motivation for learning how to plan sample sizes.\nNext, we need to clear some very common but very bad practices: we’ll discuss the perils of “run-and-check” and of just copying forward sample-sizes from previous studies. It turns out these informal approaches to sample-size determination undermine sound science.\nThe unit on effect sizes provides some of the foundational knowledge needed to understand sample-size planning. Specifically, we define effect sizes, discuss how they can be expressed in different units, and provide some tips on how to build “effect size zoos” and start thinking in effect sizes.\nFinally, we get to the actual nitty-gritty of sample-size planning, covering three major approaches:\n\nPlanning for Power\nPlanning for Precision\nPlanning for Evidence (still under development)\n\nWith an understanding of some of the different approaches to sample-size planning, we’re ready for a check-list for a quality sample-size plan and to review some model plans.\nLast but not least, this workshop describes some important strategies for dealing with sample-size sticker shock. There are lots of ways to optimize your experiments to help reduce your sample-size needs and get more information out of your experiments.",

    "text": "Exploration: The Perils of Inadequate Samples, Even When p &lt; .05\nLet’s explore why inadequate samples are so problematic.\nImagine you are measuring the effect of maternal separation on gene expression in the hippocampus. You’ll have two groups: Control and Separated. You’ll use qPCR to measure expression of egr1, a constituitvely-expressed gene that plays an important role in learning and memory.\nWithout a sample-size plan, you’d likely rely on the previous literature or lab practices to set a sample size. In qPCR experiments like this one, n = 6/group is pretty common, so that’s what you decide to go with.\nLet’s suppose that in this case, your research hypothesis is absolutely correct: maternal separation does produce a large and robust increase in egr1 expression. We’ll set the effect size at 1 standard deviation (Cohen’s d = 1; see the section on effect sizes if you’re not sure what this means).\nThis sounds like an ideal situation: the researcher has a hypothesis that is actually correct! Let’s see, though, what happens when this true hypothesis is investigated with n = 6/group.\n\nSimulation\nIn the simulation below, we randomly generate gene-expression data for the Control and Separated groups, drawing the data from distributions that are 1 standard deviation apart. With each draw we then run a t-test and check to see if it is statistically significant or not. Given that the researcher’s hypothesis is true, we might expect this experiment to always “work”, regularly producing p &lt; .05. In fact, though, it does not.!\n\n# If needed, install needed libraries\nif (!require(\"statpsych\")) install.packages(\"statpsych\")\nif (!require(\"ggplot2\")) install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nif (!require(\"gganimate\")) install.packages(\"gganimate\")\nif (!require(\"gifski\")) install.packages(\"gifski\")\n\n\n# Load needed libraries\nlibrary(statpsych)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gganimate)\n\n\n# Simulation parameters\neffect_size_in_sds &lt;- 1\nsamples_per_group &lt;- 6\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\nsimcount &lt;- 10000\n\n# Initialize variables for results\nsigfindings &lt;- 0\nall_res &lt;- data.frame(d = NA, p = NA, distortion = NA, sample = NA, CIlength = NA)\n\n# Now do the simulations\nfor (i in 1:simcount) {\n  # Control group \n  control &lt;- rnorm(samples_per_group, 0, 1)\n  # Experimental group\n  experimental &lt;- rnorm(samples_per_group, 0, 1) + effect_size_in_sds\n  # Analyze with a t-test\n  myres &lt;- t.test(control, experimental)\n  # Increase counter if a significant finding\n  if (myres$p.value &lt; alpha) sigfindings &lt;- sigfindings + 1\n  # Express this finding in Cohen's d\n  myd &lt;- statpsych::ci.stdmean2(\n    alpha = alpha,\n    m2 = mean(control),\n    m1 = mean(experimental),\n    sd2 = sd(control),\n    sd1 = sd(experimental),\n    n2 = length(control),\n    n1 = length(experimental)\n  )\n  \n  # Store the result of this sample\n  all_res[i, ] &lt;- c(\n    myd[1, 2],\n    myres$p.value,\n    myd[1, 2] / effect_size_in_sds,\n    i,\n    myd[1, 5] - myd[1, 4]\n  )\n  \n}\n\nprint(paste(\"Simulated\", simcount, \"2-group experiments with n =\", samples_per_group, \"/group and a true effect of\", effect_size_in_sds, \"standard deviations.\"))\nprint(\"Proportion of statistically significant findings (p &lt; .05):\")\nprint(sigfindings/simcount)\nprint(\"Typical margin of error:\")\nprint(mean(all_res$CIlength/2))\n\n\n\nSimulation Results: Power\nThe code above simulates 10000 2-group experiments with n = 6 and a true effect of 1 standard deviations.\nUnder this scenario, where there is a large effect, only 33.6% of samples yield statistically significant results (p &lt; .05).\nThis sample-size is inadequate because the typical margin of error is 1.38\nAs you can see, only about 33% of experiments yield p &lt; .05 even though there is a real and substantial effect to be observed! Why so low? Well, consider that statistical tests examine if the difference observed (signal) is substantially greater than expected sampling error (noise). With the sample-size we selected, though, expected sampling error is large: in fact, the margin of error in these studies is typically ~1.37 standard deviations, far larger than the signal it would be reasonable to expect!\nIf the noise in this type of study is bigger than the signal, how do any of the experiments still turn out to be statistically significant? This occurs when sampling error breaks in just the right way to distort the effect–to make it seem much bigger than it really is, so that, for that misleading sample at least, the effect observed is substantially larger than the real truth. Uh oh! That’s right, in these cases p &lt; .05 can only occur by mis-characterizing the actual truth.\n\n\nSimulation Results: Observed Effect Sizes\nLet’s see this in more detail. ?@fig-effect_size_inlfation plots the effect observed in each study. The line at 1 standard deviation represents the true effect. Because of sampling error, studies “dance” around this truth – some get a bit too large of an effect, others a bit too small. Notice, though, the coloring, which represents statistical significance of each simulated experiment. Most of the dots are blue, not significant – that’s the low power of the experiment. But note that the statistically significant findings (the red dots) all studies that radically over-estimated the real truth:\n\ntime_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = all_res[all_res$sample &lt; 200, ], aes(x=sample, y = d, colour = (p &lt; alpha)))\ntime_plot &lt;- time_plot + ylab(\"Standardized Mean Difference in egr Expression (Experimental vs. Control)\")\ntime_plot &lt;- time_plot + geom_point(aes(group = sample))\ntime_plot &lt;- time_plot + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = \"none\")\ntime_plot &lt;- time_plot + scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"red\", \"FALSE\" = \"dodgerblue1\"))\ntime_plot &lt;- time_plot + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\")\ntime_plot &lt;- time_plot + geom_hline(yintercept = 1)\ntime_plot &lt;- time_plot + transition_reveal(sample)\nanimate(time_plot, fps = 6, renderer = gifski_renderer(\"d_over_time_updated.gif\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Observed effect sizes by stat significance status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulation Results: Effect-Size Inflation Among Significant Results\nHow bad is this over-estimation? Let’s find out:\n\nprint(\"In this scenario, the true effect size is 1 standard deviations\")\nprint(\"Across all stimulated studies, the average effect size observed is:\")\nmean(all_res$d)\nprint(\"But for the studies that reached statistical significance, the average effect size observed is:\")\nmean(all_res[all_res$p &lt; .05, ]$d)\n\n\nIn this scenario, the true effect size is: 1 standard deviations\nAcross all stimulated studies, the average effect size observed is: 1.01\nBut for the studies that reached statistical significance, the average effect size observed is: 1.70\n\nWow! The statistically-significant effects over-state the truth by over 70%. Below is a representation of the true effect and the effect that would be reported through the statistical-significance filter:\n\n\n\nTrue Effect Size\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved Effect Size when p &lt; .05.\n(hat-tip to the R Psychologist for the figures; https://rpsychologist.com/cohend/)\n\n\nThat’s a big distortion, and it really matters. It means:\n\nWhat seems like a major/breakthrough effect may actually be more modest\nFollow-up studies done at the same sample-size are more likely than not to fail!\n\nThis is the difficult truth about inadequate sample-sizes: it’s not just about the waste of not detecting true effects. Inadequate samples are problematic because the significant findings they generate are likely to be distorted and misleading. It’s very difficult to do fruitful, generative science if what you publish is a distorted view of reality.",
