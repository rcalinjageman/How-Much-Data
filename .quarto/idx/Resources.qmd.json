Although the approach is easy to adopt, it is important to remember that:\n\n-   Effect sizes in the published literature may be biased, and\n\n-   Effect sizes estimated from small samples are often uncertain.\n\nTherefore, it is a good idea to hedge your sample-size estimatesagainst both bias and uncertainty.\n\nKen Kelley's group has an approach that does this:\n\n-   The R package of tools is called BUCSS-- Bias and Unertainty Corrected Sample Sizes: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BUCSS/index.html>\n\n-   The website [designingexperiments.com](https://designingexperiments.com/shiny-r-web-apps/) has web apps that allow you to plan for power in this careful way without having to learn R. Scroll to the bottom of the page of webapps to select your design and load the appropriate web app.\n\n-   A paper describing this approach is here: Anderson, S. F., Kelley, K., & Maxwell, S. E. (2017). Sample-Size Planning for More Accurate Statistical Power: A Method Adjusting Sample Effect Sizes for Publication Bias and Uncertainty. Psychological Science, 95679761772372. <https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797617723724>\n\n#### Sequential Testing\n\nIf you are going to use planning for power, sequential testing can be more efficient, especially in the exploratory phase of research. Lakens offers an excellent tutorial:\n\n-   Lakens, D. (2014). Performing high-powered studies efficiently with sequential analyses. European Journal of Social Psychology, 44(7), 701–710. <https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2023>\n\n### Planning for Precision\n\nPlanning for precision is also known as Accuracy in Parameter Estimatation (AIPE). In this approach, the researcher's goal is to control the noise/error in the result--a sample size is selected that will give a reasonable margin of error relative to the research question and the scale of measurement.\n\nOne set of readings and tools are from Geoff Cumming and his collaborators:\n\n-   esci - Is a free set of online tools for understanding as well as an R package for data analysis. Here is a link to planning-for-precision functions in the online tools included in esci: <https://esci.thenewstatistics.com/esci-precision.html#tab-1>\n\n-   Cumming has two books which have coverage on planning for precision. Both are readable and accessible to a general scientific audience.\n\n    -   This book is for those already well-versed in p values: Cumming, G. (2011). [Understanding the new statistics: Effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-New-Statistics-Meta-Analysis-Multivariate/dp/041587968X). New York: Routledge.\n\n    -   This book is for undergraduates learning stats, but has a bit more updated material on planning for precision: Cumming, G., & Calin-Jageman, R. J. (2024, 2nd edition). [Introduction to the new statistics: Estimation, open science, and beyond](https://www.routledge.com/Introduction-to-the-New-Statistics-Estimation-Open-Science-and-Beyond/Cumming-Calin-Jageman/p/book/9781138825529). New York: Routledge.\n\nAnother set of readings and tools are from Ken Kelley and his collaborators.\n\n-   [MBESS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MBESS/index.html)  - Is a free R package that contains many different useful functions. Among those are functions for planning for precision (which Kelley terms AIPE). The functions in MBESS are complex, but they can be used for a wide variety of experimental designs. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MBESS/index.html>\n\n-   [DesigningExperiments.com](https://designingexperiments.com/shiny-r-web-apps/) has free web applications that allow planning for precision with the functions embedded into MBESS. This makes them easier to use. Given that they can handle complex designs, it is not surprising that the learning curve is a bit steep even for the web application.\n\n-   Kelley and his colleagues have a number of papers and sources on the AIPE approach. Also reccomended is his excellent book [*Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data*](https://www.crcpress.com/Designing-Experiments-and-Analyzing-Data-A-Model-Comparison-Perspective/Maxwell-Delaney-Kelley/p/book/9781138892286).\n\n    -   Maxwell, S.

John Kruschke has written a book and provides excellent tools for what her terms the Bayesian New Statistics:\n\n-   Kruschke, J (2014). Doing Bayesian Data Analysis. Eslevier. <https://www.elsevier.com/books/doing-bayesian-data-analysis/kruschke/978-0-12-405888-0>\n\n-   Kruschke, J. K., & Liddell, T. M. (2017).

Psychonomic Bulletin & Review. <https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-016-1221-4>\n\n### Other Approaches to Planning\n\nThere are lots of other good ways to plan your studies..I couldn't cover them all. Here are three noteworthy papers and approaches.\n\n-   Planning for Evidence - If you like Bayesian hypothesis testing, a very good approach is to plan for evidence rather than sample size. That is, you can commit to collecting data until you achieve clear evidence for your hypothesis or for the null hypothesis. It sounds scary because data collection is therefore open-ended, yet simulations show this can actually be a very efficient approach.\n\n    -   Schönbrodt, F. D., & Wagenmakers, E.-J. (2017). Bayes factor design analysis: Planning for compelling evidence. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 1–16. <https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-017-1230-y>\n\nPlanning for Stability - not too different from planning for precision, this approach is to select a sample-size that will provide enough information that subsequent replications will achieve similar results within a set level of similarity.\n\n-   Lakens, D., & Evers, E. R. K. (2014). Sailing From the Seas of Chaos Into the Corridor of Stability: Practical Recommendations to Increase the Informational Value of Studies. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 9(3), 278–292. <https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691614528520>\n\n-   Gelman's approach:\n\n    -   Gelman, A., & Carlin, J. (2014).

John Kruschke has written a book and provides excellent tools for what her terms the Bayesian New Statistics:\n\n-   Kruschke, J (2014). Doing Bayesian Data Analysis.

Here are three noteworthy papers and approaches.\n\n-   Planning for Evidence - If you like Bayesian hypothesis testing, a very good approach is to plan for evidence rather than sample size. That is, you can commit to collecting data until you achieve clear evidence for your hypothesis or for the null hypothesis. It sounds scary because data collection is therefore open-ended, yet simulations show this can actually be a very efficient approach.\n\n    -   Schönbrodt, F. D., & Wagenmakers, E.-J. (2017). Bayes factor design analysis: Planning for compelling evidence. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 1–16. <https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-017-1230-y>\n\nPlanning for Stability - not too different from planning for precision, this approach is to select a sample-size that will provide enough information that subsequent replications will achieve similar results within a set level of similarity.\n\n-   Lakens, D., & Evers, E. R. K. (2014). Sailing From the Seas of Chaos Into the Corridor of Stability: Practical Recommendations to Increase the Informational Value of Studies. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 9(3), 278–292. <https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691614528520>\n\n-   Gelman's approach:\n\n    -   Gelman, A., & Carlin, J. (2014).
