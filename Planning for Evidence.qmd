Bayesian statistics offers a very different path for sample-size determination: Planning for evidence.

One especially compelling version of this approach is called open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, in which the researcher collects data until compelling evidence emerges for their hypothesis or the null.

Despite the best-laid plans, a module on planning for evidence is not ready for release yet. Please stay tuned. In the meantime, the most authoritative and accessible resources for this approach is [@sch√∂nbrodt2017].
