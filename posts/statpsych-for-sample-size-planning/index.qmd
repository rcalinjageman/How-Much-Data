One great tool for sample-size planning is the [statpsych](https://github.com/dgbonett/statpsych/) package by Doug Bonett.

There are loads and loads of goodies in statpsych, and [the documentation](https://dgbonett.github.io/statpsych/reference/index.html) is excellent and authoritative.

Here, for example, is how you can find the sample-size needed to obtain a desired level of power for a predicted effect in a 2-group design

```{r}
# If you don't have statpsych installed, install it!
if (!require("statpsych")) install.packages("statpsych")

# size.test.mean2 gives power for the mean difference in a 2-group design
# parameters are alpha level, desired power, average within-group variance, effect size, and ratio of group1 to group2 sample sizes
# Full documentation is at: https://dgbonett.github.io/statpsych/reference/size.test.mean2.html
# In this example, we have 
#  * an alpha of .05, 
#  * desired power of .95, 
#  * expected average variance of 100 (sd_avg = 10)
#  * an predicted effect size of 10
#  * and equal sample-sizes in both groups (ratio of 1 between n1 and n2)
# The output shows that we need n = 27 per group.
statpsych::size.test.mean2(.05, .95, 100, 10, 1) 


# We can easiy investigate other effect sizes, power levels, etc.  For example:
#  Here we explore effect sizes of 5, 10, and 20 while keeping
#  all other parameters constant
for(e_size in c(5, 10, 20)){
  print(
    paste(
      "For effect size of", e_size,
      "need sample size of", 
      paste(statpsych::size.test.mean2(.05, .95, 100, e_size, 1), collapse = ", ")
    )
  )
  
}
```
