Just as important as a reasonable sample is good study design that mitigates the risks of bias.

To that end, *eNeuro* has a great new paper by Richard Born (Harvard) about how to diagnose and avoid confirmation bias [@born2024]. The full text is here: <https://www.eneuro.org/content/11/10/ENEURO.0415-24.2024>

This paper is part of a series on *Improving Your Neuroscience* that I (R.C-J.) am helping to organize [@calin-jageman2024]. You can find a list of all papers as they appear in this series here: <https://www.eneuro.org/collection/improving-your-neuroscience>

I strongly recommend this lovely paper â€“ it is full of fascinating examples and references; it is the type of paper you'll want to assign to all your incoming trainees.
